# Brief Introduction to Object Oriented Programming Design

## OOP vs Procedural Programming
I actually wanted to start this section with the title "why OOP?". Then I realised making a comparasion between Procedural Programming and OOP would better help you understand the merits of OOP over Procedural. The top down design methd is used in Procedural Programming. Generally, in this language such as C, a problem (a procedure) will be broken down into several sub problems (sub procedures), and those sub problems can be split into more sub problems until the big problem can be solved. Using this method would cause hard maintenance of the code when the stucture on the top of the hierarchy needs to be changed. However, in OOP languages, maintaining the code would be much easier because the modules are based on classes. But the tradeoff with OOP languages is that more code lines are needed than Procedural Programming.

The examples are given in Java language, and here are some keypoints in OOP.

## Class & Object
A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type.

## Class Body
A class body usually includes zero or more attributes to represent the properties of a object. In addition, one class can also have zero or more methods to represent the behaviours of the corresponding object.

### Attributes
Attributes indicate what properities that a object has. For example, a "Human" object could have attributes such as "arms", "legs", "body" and "brain" etc. A car object could have attributes such as "wheels" and "chassis". Naming a attribute of an object should be a noun rather than a objective or a verb. For instance, A "Human" object has attributes like "beautiful" or "run" would sounds inappropriate.

### Methods
Methods are the actions that a object can perform. For example, a "Human" object can perform actions such as "jump", "run" and "shout". Hence, the method name should be a verb ranther than "hair", "nose" or "legs".


## Abstraction & Encapsulation
```java
abstract class Robot
{
    //attributes
    private String name;

    //methods
    public void greeting()
    {
        System.out.println("Hi, I am a robot");
    }

    abstract void move();
    
    //Getter and Setter methods
    public String getName()
    {
        return name;
    }
    public void setName(String name)
    {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

## Inheritance & Polymorphism
```java

```
