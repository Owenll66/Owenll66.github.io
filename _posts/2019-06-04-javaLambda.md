# Brief discuss about Lambda expression in Java

## Why Lambda expression

Lambdas introduces functional programming in Java which is known as an Object Oriented Programming language. One of the benefits of using Lambdas is that it makes code simpler and easy to understand. In addition, Java 1.8 provides easy-to-use lambda APIs and libraries which also support parallel processing.

## Values vs Functions

Lambda enables assigning a block of code to a variable. Normally, a function needs to specify its scope, return type and function name. However, when you assign a code block using lambda expression, neither of these are needed.
For example:
